            Every year, millions of tons of coffee grounds end up in landfills.
            When left to decompose alongside other organic waste, these grounds
            release methane gas—one of the most harmful greenhouse gases driving
            climate change. In a city like Makassar, where coffee culture is
            rapidly growing, this challenge becomes even more visible: from
            cafés to households, coffee waste keeps piling up every single day.

            For us, coffee waste is not the end of the story. It is the
            beginning of a new journey. What many see as residue, we see as an
            opportunity to give a second life. We believe that what is often
            overlooked can be transformed into something useful, valuable, and
            even beautiful when handled with care.

            Behind every product we create—from soap, candles, and car
            fragrances to biochar—lies a simple conviction: nothing should go to
            waste. Every grain of coffee grounds carries a story, and through
            the right hands, that story can be rewritten into a solution for our
            planet.

            Rebru stands as a reminder to all of us: from the small remnants
            left in your coffee cup, we can spark big changes that protect the
            environment, empower communities, and build a greener future.
          </p>

          <p>
            And now, we invite you to be part of this journey. Whether you are a
            coffee shop, a business, or an individual who cares about the
            planet, your involvement matters. Together, we can ensure that no
            coffee waste goes to waste—and that every cup contributes to a more
            sustainable tomorrow.
